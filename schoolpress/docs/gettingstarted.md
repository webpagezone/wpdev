Getting Started with SchoolPress
===========
This document will contain intrustions and tips for navigating the SchoolPress code and getting it running on your site.

Demo
---------------------
A working example of this code can be found at http://schoolpress.me

The code base in this respository is the exact code (minus any sensitive settings) that runs the site at http://schoolpress.me.

Note: There are parts of this codebase that are assuming specific domains, page names, and other settings that are in use at the SchoolPress site. We will be generalizing these bits of code as soon as we can. Help with that is appreciated.

Main Sections of the Repository (Note: Make these locations links to GitHub pages.)

Plugins Used
---------------------
### akismet
Default WordPress plugin for controlling spam comments on a site.

### bbpress
Powers the forums for each class.

### bp-site-groups
Plugin created for SchoolPress. [Separate repository here](https://github.com/strangerstudios/bp-site-groups). By default BuddyPress creates groups network-wide in a WordPress multisite install. This plugin helps to make groups visible only on the subsite where they were created.

### buddypress
Powers the groups functionality for each class.

### coming-soon
Not currently used. Was used when SchoolPress was in closed alpha.

### js-display-name
Load the display name of a WordPress user via JavaScript. [Separate repository here](https://github.com/strangerstudios/js-display-name).

### kint-debugger
Used for debugging during development.

### paid-memberships-pro
Used to manage membership levels and charging for school members.

### pmpro-network
Used to automatically create a new subsite when a "school" member checks out.

### pmpro-network-subsite
Used on the open.schoolpress.me and testschool.schoolpress.me sites to link student/teacher/school membership levels with the levels from the main site. So at open.schoolpress.me, your membership level is based on your level on the main schoolpress.me site. With this plugin deactivated (say at privateschool.schoolpress.me) you would need a teacher membership at that specific site to create and manage classes.

### schoolpress
The main application plugin. Includes classes to manage schools, students, teachers, classes, and assignments. Also includes page templates for my classes, add/edit classes, and add/edit assignments pages.

### ss-file-folders

### theme-my-login
Used to show the WordPress login on the frontend of the site and keep non-admins from viewing the dashboard.

### wordpress-beta-tester
Used to download bleeding-edge versions of WordPress for testing.

### wp-doc

### wp-multisite-smtp
