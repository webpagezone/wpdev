Sample Network/Multisite Setup for Sites Running Paid Memberships Pro. This plugin requires the Paid Memberships Pro plugin, which can be found in the WordPress repository.

== Description ==

With the Paid Memberships Pro plugin and this plugin activated, new users will be able to choose a site name and title at checkout. A site will be created for them after registering. If they cancel their membership or have it removed, the site will be deactivated. If they sign up for a membership again, the site will be reactivated.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have the Paid Memberships Pro plugin installed and activated.
1. Make sure you have properly configured Network Sites on your WP install.
1. Upload the `pmpro-network` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

To use site credits:

1. Set the "PMPRO_NETWORK_MANAGE_SITES_SLUG" constant in the pmpro-network.php file.
2. Add code like this to your main site's active theme's functions.php or another custom plugin:

`
//set site credits for levels 1-3
function pmpro_multi_pmpron_site_credits($credits, $user_id, $level_id)
{	
	if($level_id == 1)
		$credits = 1;
	elseif($level_id == 2)
		$credits = 3;
	elseif($level_id == 3)
		$credits = 9999;

	return $credits;
}
add_filter("pmpron_site_credits", "pmpro_multi_pmpron_site_credits", 10, 3);
`
