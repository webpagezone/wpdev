Description: The 2013 theme for WordPress takes us back to the blog, 
featuring a full range of post formats, each displayed beautifully in their 
own unique way. Design details abound, starting with a gorgeous color scheme and 
matching header images, optional display fonts for beautiful typography, and a 
wide layout that looks great on large screens yet remains device-agnostic 
and is readable on any device.
