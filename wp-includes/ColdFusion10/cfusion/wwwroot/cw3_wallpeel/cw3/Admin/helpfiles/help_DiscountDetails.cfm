<h2>Discount Details  Help</h2>
<p> The Discount Details page allows you to add a new discount or modify an existing discount. Discounts have a user-friendly name and a reference ID for store owner use. When creating a discount, you specifiy a start date and an end date for the discount. After the end date, the discount no longer applies. Discounts automatically expire when the end date is reached. A discount description can be given, and will show in the store if the configuration item &quot;Display Discount Notes on Cart&quot; is checked in the admin. </p>
<p>Discounts can be used store-wide with or without promotional codes. Promotional codes are entered by the user during the checkout process and do not show on the product pages until the user has entered the correct promo code in the checkout. If no promotional code is given in the admin, no promotional code is required by the store customers, and discounts show up on the product pages. </p>
<p>Discounts amounts can be in percentage or currency amounts, and can apply to all products or specific products/skus. </p>
