<h2>Archived Products</h2>
<p> Here you may view a list of products that have been Archived. If you wish to reactivate a product so it will be available on the store and can be edited, simply click the &quot;reactivate&quot; link. The product will be removed from the Archived list and given an Active status. You will then be taken to the Product Admin Form where you can edit the product record if you wish.</p>
