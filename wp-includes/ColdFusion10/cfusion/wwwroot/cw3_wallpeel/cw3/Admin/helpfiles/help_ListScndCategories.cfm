<h2>Secondary Categories </h2>
<p> Secondary categories act as subcategories, but they can be searched on directly without an associated category. A product can be related to an unlimited number of secondary categories.</p>
<h3>Sorting: </h3>
<p> The Sort Order field allows you to &quot;force&quot; the order in which the secondary categories are sorted, rather than relying on alphabetical sorting or by the order the secondary categories were created in the database.</p>
<h3>Powerful Search Solution </h3>
<p>The real power in this is the flexibility with which products can be searched for. For example, you can narrow or refine a search using secondary categories by searching for Clothing (category) / Men's (secondary category). In this way the secondary category acts like a traditional subcategory. Because there is no direct relationship between categories and secondary categories, you can easily widen your search by searching for &quot;Men's&quot; (secondary category only) This will return results of all products with a relationship to the Men's secondary category, regardless of what category they are in, such as Shoes and Shirts.</p>
<h3>Note: Relating Categories with Secondaries</h3>
<p>You can choose to relate Categories with Secondaries using the Store Settings &gt; Display Settings, however the relationships are determined at the product level. For example, if you create a product under &quot;Clothing&quot; as a category, and &quot;Men's&quot; as a secondary, &quot;Clothing&quot; and &quot;Men's&quot; will now be related</p>
