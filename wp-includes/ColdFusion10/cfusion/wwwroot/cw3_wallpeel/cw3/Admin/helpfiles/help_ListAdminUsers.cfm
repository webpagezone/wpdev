<h2>Admin Users</h2>
<h3>Granting Access to Admin</h3>
<p> The Users List is a record of all usernames and passwords that grant access to the Administration area. You can easily add new users and modify or delete existing users as needed. You may not delete the last user record, as there must always be at least one admin user. You can also give users different access levels. By default, Cartweaver has two access levels -- admin and superadmin. The superadmin has access to everything in the Administration area, including web site configuraration. Regular admin users have access to administer the store.</p>
<h3>Security Note:</h3>
<p>Be sure to create a new administrator username and password and delete the default record of admin/admin before your store goes live. </p>
